# Nessus Essentials Lab: Vulnerability Management

## Description
Todayâ€™s lab is going to be on Vulnerability Management. We are going to be building a Vulnerability Management Lab where we install Nessus Essentials on our host machine and create a virtual environment with VMWare Workstation 17 by downloading a free copy of the Windows 10 operating system and running it inside a virtual machine (VM). We will even be installing some old, deprecated software in the Windows OS. We will conduct some vulnerability scans against that virtual machine in order to discover any vulnerabilities that might be on it. Then we are going to go ahead and remediate one or two of those so that we can observe what is happening in real time.

The first scan will be a non-credentialed scan before any updates have been applied to the target machine. The second scan will be a credentialed scan before any updates have been applied. The third and final scan will be a credentialed scan of the target vm after updates have been applied. At the end of this lab, I will compare the results of the three scans.

## Results and Takeaways

### Scan 1 Target Re-configured (Credentialed) Results
| Risk Raiting | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | 2.00% |
| High | 2.00% |
| Medium | 2.00% |
| Low | 0.00% |
| Info | 95.00% |
| **Total** | **100.00%** |

Non-credentialed scans are not as useful as credentialed scans when trying to get an accurate view of vulnerabilities that exist on a device or network because they lack proper access. Non-credentialed scans cannot see vulnerabilities that may exist on parts of a device or network that are off limits without proper authentication. As a result, non-credentialed scans produce far less results than credentialed scans. That makes credentials very important to a threat actor because of the access it gives them. Run credentialed scans when possible.

### Scan 2 - Firefox (Credentialed) Results
| Risk Raiting | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | 27.00% |
| High | 26.00% |
| Medium | 6.00% |
| Low | 0.00% |
| Info | 40.00% |
| **Total** | **100.00%** |

The second ccredentialed scan was on a target running third-party software that was outdated. Even if the Targer VM was running an up-to-date OS, the thrid-party software would still  leave it open to attacks. The more third-party software you have installed the larger the attack surface you create. Zero trust and system hardening are ways to minimize your attack surface so that you minimize your vulnerability count.

### Scan 3 - Remediated (Credentialed) Results
| Risk Raiting | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | 2.00% |
| High | 2.00% |
| Medium | 2.00% |
| Low | 0.00% |
| Info | 94.00% |
| **Total** | **100.00%** |

The third credentialed scan after remediations were implemented show far less vulnerabilities than the previous credentialed scans run before updates were applied. These results demonstrate the importance of scheduling regular vulnerability scans against networks and devices. They also show that keeping systems up to date with the latest patches can drastically reduce the number of vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit.

###  Takeaways

- [ ] The Vulnerability Management Cycle consists mainly of scanning and remediating
- [ ] Secure your Credentials from Threat Actors (Internal included)
- [ ] Third-Party Software enlarges your attack surface - minimize its use where possible
- [ ] More goes into it when large organizations necessitate Policies and Procedures around the cycle
- [ ] Automate as much as possible (Windows Updates | Third-Party Updates)
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with CVSS - Common Vulnerability Scanning System
