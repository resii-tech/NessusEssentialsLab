# Nessus Essentials Lab: Vulnerability Management

## Description
Todayâ€™s lab is going to be on Vulnerability Management. We are going to be building a Vulnerability Management Lab where we install Nessus Essentials on our host machine and create a virtual environment with VMWare Workstation 17 by downloading a free copy of the Windows 10 operating system and running it inside a virtual machine (VM). We will even be installing some old, deprecated software in the Windows OS. We will conduct some vulnerability scans against that virtual machine in order to discover any vulnerabilities that might be on it. Then we are going to go ahead and remediate one or two of those so that we can observe what is happening in real time.

The first scan will be a non-credentialed scan before any updates have been applied to the target machine. The second scan will be a credentialed scan before any updates have been applied. The third and final scan will be a credentialed scan of the target vm after updates have been applied. At the end of this lab, I will compare the results of the three scans.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Provisioning and deprovisioning virtual environments within VMware for Windows 10.
2. Run initial vulnerability scan without credentials against vm and observe results.
3. Run a credentialed vulnerability scan with the addition of deprecated software added in.
4. Perform andalysis and remediation of issues and run  final scan to verify remediation was successful.

### Technologies and Protocols:
* VMware Workstation 17 Player
* Nessus Essentials 
* Windows ISO + Firefox 3.6.12

> NOTE: This lab will be done on a Windows machine.

## Results

### Scan 1 (Non-credentialed) Results
| Risk Raiting | Count | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | 0 | 0.00% |
| High | 0 | 0.00% |
| Medium | 1 | 1.45% |
| Low | 1 | 1.45% |
| Info | 67 | 97.10% |
| **Total** | **69** | **100.00%** |

The first scan was a non-credentialed scan before any updates were applied to the domain controller. This scan produced 1 medium, 1 low, and 67 info results. Non-credentialed scans are not as useful as credentialed scans when trying to get an accurate view of vulnerabilities that exist on a device or network because they lack proper access. Non-credentialed scans cannot see vulnerabilities that may exist on parts of a device or network that are off limits without proper authentication. As a result, non-credentialed scans produce far less results than credentialed scans.

### Scan 2 (Credentialed) Results
| Risk Raiting | Count | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | 10 | 3.79% |
| High | 7 | 2.65% |
| Medium | 6 | 2.27% |
| Low | 1 | 0.38% |
| Info | 240 | 90.91% |
| **Total** | **264** | **100.00%** |

The second scan was a credentialed scan before any updates were applied to the domain controller. This scan produced 10 critical, 7 high, 6 medium, 1 low, and 240 info results. Since this scan was configured with the proper credentials, a lot more results were produced.

### Scan 3 (Credentialed) Results
| Risk Raiting | Count | Percentage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Critical | 0 | 0.00% |
| High | 0 | 0.00% |
| Medium | 1 | 1.09% |
| Low | 1 | 1.09% |
| Info | 90 | 97.83% |
| **Total** | **92** | **100.00%** |

The third scan was a credentialed scan after updates had been applied to the domain controller. The results of this scan showed far less vulnerabilities than the previous credentialed scan I ran before updates were applied. This scan produced 1 medium, 1 low, and 90 info results. All of the critical and high level vulnerabilities were fixed. These results demostrate the importance of schedueling regular vulnerability scan agaisnt networks and devices. They also show that keeping systems up to date with the latest patches can drastically reduce the number of vulnerabilities an attacker could exploit.

#### False Positive Result
The remaining medium rank vulnerability appears to be a false positive.
